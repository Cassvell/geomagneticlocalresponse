In this work we studied the regional manifestations of space weather at central
Mexico through isolate the local geomagnetic response from its planetary counterpart.
In order to do so, we analyzed 20 intense geomagnetic storms by identifying the
ionospheric contribution in their regional geomagnetic data as registered at the Magnetic
Observatory of Teoloyucan (located at the north of Mexico City). Our analysis indicated
that local geomagnetic response is mainly driven by ionospheric disturbances. We also
found that the disturbed polar current number 2 and the disturbed dynamo current are
particularly relevant for the regional geomagnetic response. Additionally, we showed
that regional geomagnetic activity can be approximated by the combined effects of the
planetary geomagnetic response and the regional magnetic perturbations induced by
the commented ionospheric currents. Finally, our results highlights the particularities
that geomagnetic response has at regional scales.
